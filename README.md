# PacMan
The goal of the game is to get higher scores instead of eating all the dots and getting to higher levels. After the players eats the dots, the dots will reappear after a few seconds. There will be four ghosts that randomly go around the maze. When the ghosts collide with the player, the player will lose a life. Every time the player gets 1000 points, a mini-game (“stack the tower”) will pop up. The points gain from the tower game will be added to the current player’s score, and the player will continue on the game until they have no more lives.
