PACMAN
--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
Prioritization: 
-Develop the main maze, characters, and dots classes
-Pacman should function by its rules (movements, and eating)
-Eaten dots reappear after a few seconds
-Move characters (using up, down, right and left) without touching the walls of the maze in processing
-Add in the in-between "tower" game
-increase speed of the ghosts after every 1000 points
--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
Extra features:
-Multiplayer??
-large dots called Power Pellets that temporarily give the player the ability to eat the ghosts
-A.I. ghosts that follow the player 
--------------------------------------------------------------
